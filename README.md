How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that they serve the same purpose in terms of making the website work when there's internet or technology issues. Both graceful degradation and service workers aim to make the site accessible when something goes wrong, i.e., graceful degradation makes sure the core content is accessible when advanced features fail, and service workers make sure the site still works offline.
